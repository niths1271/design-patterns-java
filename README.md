# SOLID PRINCIPLES
    - Single responsibility: A class should have only 1 reason to change.
    - Open/Closed principle: Open for extension but closed for modification
    - Liskov Substituition principle: If Class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking behaviour of the program (Subclass must extend the capability of parent class, not narrow it down)
    - Interface Segmented principle: Interfaces must be such that, client should not implement unnecessary functions that they do not need.
    - Dependency inversion principle: Class should depend on interfaces, rather than calling concrete classes.
